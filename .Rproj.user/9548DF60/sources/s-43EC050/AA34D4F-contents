Description: This package provide unctions for internal calibration, internal validation and external validation of a Cox PH model.
    A cox PH model need to be developed using training dataset before using this package. 
    Harrell's C-index can be calculated for internal validation in training dataset. Performing the Cox PH model using testing dataset, Uno's C-index can be calculated for external validation.
